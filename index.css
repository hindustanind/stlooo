/*
 * Empty placeholder stylesheet.
 *
 * The application imports `/index.css` via a `<link>` tag in `index.html`.  On some
 * deployment platforms (like Netlify) the absence of this file causes a build
 * warning and can result in 404s when the page is served.  Although the
 * applicationâ€™s styling is handled entirely with Tailwind and inline CSS in
 * `index.html`, providing this empty file ensures that the referenced asset
 * exists without affecting the look and feel of the app.
